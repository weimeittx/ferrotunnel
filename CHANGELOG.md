## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.6] - Unreleased

### Fixed

#### TLS
- **CLI TLS panic on first connection** ([#98](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ferrotunnel/issues/98)): The `ferrotunnel` binary panicked with `Could not automatically determine the process-level CryptoProvider` when TLS was enabled. rustls 0.23 requires `rustls::crypto::ring::default_provider().install_default()` to be called before any `ClientConfig`/`ServerConfig` is built. Added this call at the very start of `main()` in `ferrotunnel-cli` and added `rustls` as a direct dependency.

### Added

#### gRPC Support
- **gRPC tunnel support**: Transparent gRPC tunneling over HTTP/2 — no tonic or protobuf knowledge required at the tunnel layer. FerroTunnel acts as a pure HTTP/2 proxy, preserving gRPC trailers (`grpc-status`, `grpc-message`) end-to-end
- **Automatic gRPC detection**: Server-side ingress detects `Content-Type: application/grpc*` and tags the stream as `Protocol::GRPC` (the enum variant was already reserved; this release adds the full implementation)
- **HTTP/2 forwarding path in ingress**: When a gRPC stream is detected, the ingress uses `hyper::client::conn::http2::handshake` over the `VirtualStream` instead of the HTTP/1.1 path, ensuring HTTP/2 framing and trailer semantics are preserved through the tunnel
- **`LocalProxyService` h2 mode**: Added `use_h2` field and `with_pool_h2()` constructor; the service now uses `ConnectionPool::acquire_h2()` for gRPC streams, routing requests over a shared HTTP/2 connection to the local gRPC server
- **`HttpProxy::handle_grpc_stream()`**: New method on `HttpProxy<L>` that serves a `VirtualStream` as HTTP/2 using `hyper::server::conn::http2::Builder`, with a dedicated HTTP/2 connection pool (always acquiring via `acquire_h2()`) for local forwarding
- **Automatic CLI dispatch**: The CLI client dispatches `Protocol::GRPC` streams to `handle_grpc_stream()` automatically — no new flags required
- **gRPC example**: New `examples/basic/grpc_tunnel.rs` demonstrating how to tunnel any local gRPC server
- **Integration tests**: `test_grpc_tunnel` (end-to-end raw HTTP/2+gRPC through the full tunnel stack) and `test_non_grpc_not_classified_as_grpc` (regression guard for the HTTP path)
## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

#### Project Ownership
- **Repository transfer**: Project ownership transferred from MitulShah1 to the [ferro-labs](https://github.com/ferro-labs) organization. Repository is now at <https://github.com/ferro-labs/ferrotunnel>
- **Updated all references**: GitHub URLs, GHCR image paths (`ghcr.io/ferro-labs/ferrotunnel`), and Homebrew tap (`brew tap ferro-labs/ferrotunnel`) updated throughout the codebase

#### Code Quality
- **Refactor `ClientFeatureArgs` struct**: Replaced excessive boolean fields with nested configuration structs (`DashboardConfig`, `TlsConfig`, `TelemetryConfig`) using `#[command(flatten)]`, removing the `#[allow(clippy::struct_excessive_bools)]` suppression ([#76](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ferrotunnel/issues/76))
- **Remove `unnecessary_literal_bound` allow directives**: Cleaned up redundant `#[allow(clippy::unnecessary_literal_bound)]` suppressions across plugin modules (`auth.rs`, `rate_limit.rs`, `logger.rs`, `circuit_breaker.rs`) ([#77](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ferrotunnel/issues/77))

### Fixed

#### Safety
- **Safe integer truncation in timestamp conversions**: Replaced `as_millis() as u64` casts in tunnel client and server with `.min(u64::MAX as u128) as u64`, removing `#[allow(clippy::cast_possible_truncation)]` suppressions and making truncation behaviour explicit ([#78](https://github.com/ferro-labs/ferrotunnel/issues/78))

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-16

### Added

#### HTTP/2 Support
- **HTTP/2 ingress**: Server-side ingress now supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 via automatic protocol detection using `hyper-util`'s `AutoBuilder`
- **HTTP/2 protocol variant**: Added `HTTP2` variant to the `Protocol` enum for future protocol-specific handling
- **Connection-close error filtering**: Added helper function to reduce log noise from benign connection close errors

#### Connection Pooling
- **Connection pool module**: New `pool` module (`ferrotunnel-http/src/pool.rs`) for efficient connection reuse
- **HTTP/1.1 pooling**: Idle HTTP/1.1 connections are stored in a LIFO queue (VecDeque) for cache warmth, with configurable limits (default: 32 per host, 90s timeout)
- **HTTP/2 multiplexing**: Single shared HTTP/2 connection per target with automatic clone-cheap multiplexing
- **Background eviction**: Automatic cleanup of expired idle connections every 30 seconds
- **Pool configuration**: `PoolConfig` struct with `max_idle_per_host`, `idle_timeout`, and `prefer_h2` options
- **`HttpProxy::with_pool_config()`**: New constructor for custom pool configuration

### Changed

#### Performance
- **Client proxy connection reuse**: `LocalProxyService` now acquires connections from the pool instead of creating new TCP connections per request, significantly reducing connection overhead
- **Connection lifecycle management**: Connections are returned to the pool after successful requests, but not for upgraded (WebSocket) connections or failed requests

#### Dependencies
- **hyper**: Added `http2` feature flag
- **hyper-util**: Added `server-auto` and `tokio` features for HTTP/2 auto-detection
- **thiserror**: Added for connection pool error types

### Fixed
- **Test compatibility**: Connection pool constructor now checks for tokio runtime availability before spawning background tasks, preventing test failures

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-11

### Added

#### WebSocket Tunneling
- **Full WebSocket tunnel support**: Transparent WebSocket upgrade handling through the tunnel — real-time applications (chat, dashboards, gaming) now work out of the box
- **Automatic upgrade detection**: HTTP ingress detects `Connection: Upgrade` + `Upgrade: websocket` headers and opens streams with `Protocol::WebSocket`
- **Bidirectional bridging**: After the 101 handshake, upgraded connections are bridged with zero-copy `copy_bidirectional` for minimal overhead
- **End-to-end integration tests**: Two new WebSocket integration tests (`test_websocket_upgrade_through_tunnel`, `test_websocket_raw_upgrade_101`)

#### Graceful Shutdown
- **CLI signal handling**: Both `ferrotunnel server` and `ferrotunnel client` now handle Ctrl-C / SIGTERM gracefully, logging shutdown and cleaning up resources before exit
- **Server shutdown**: Server `tokio::select!` races all services against `ctrl_c()` for clean process termination
- **Client shutdown**: Client reconnection loop exits cleanly on signal, calling `shutdown_tracing()` before exit

### Changed

#### HTTP Proxy
- **Upgrade support**: HTTP/1 connections in both ingress and proxy now use `.with_upgrades()` for hyper upgrade protocol compatibility

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-07

### Added

#### Installation
- **Homebrew Formula**: Introduce `brew install ferrotunnel` command for macOS users via [ferro-labs/homebrew-ferrotunnel](https://github.com/ferro-labs/homebrew-ferrotunnel) tap

#### Tunnel Routing
- **`--tunnel-id` CLI flag**: New `--tunnel-id` option for `ferrotunnel client` to set the tunnel ID used for HTTP Host-header routing (`FERROTUNNEL_TUNNEL_ID` env var supported)
- **`.tunnel_id()` builder method**: New method on `Client::builder()` for setting the tunnel ID when using the library API

### Fixed

#### Tunnel Routing
- **HTTP ingress routing**: Fixed "Tunnel not found" error when accessing tunnels via direct IP. The client now registers a `tunnel_id` that matches the Host header used by incoming HTTP requests

#### Docker Verification
- **Metrics Endpoint**: Fixed issue where the metrics server was not enabled by default in the Docker environment, causing verification scripts to report missing data.

### Improved

#### Docker Optimization
- **Optimized Docker image size**: Reduced from 34.8 MB to **13.4 MB** (61.6% smaller)
- **Faster build times**: Build time reduced from 6.5 minutes to **2.5 minutes** (62% faster)
- **Minimal base image**: Switched to Google's `distroless/cc-debian12` for minimal attack surface
- **Aggressive compiler optimizations**: Size-focused compile flags (`-C opt-level=z`, single codegen unit, panic=abort)
- **Enhanced caching**: cargo-chef for faster incremental builds
- **Binary stripping**: Comprehensive symbol removal for smaller binaries

#### Documentation
- Enhanced README with security comparisons and CVE analysis
- Updated ROADMAP to prioritize user adoption (WebSocket, HTTP/2, gRPC)
- Improved architecture diagrams
